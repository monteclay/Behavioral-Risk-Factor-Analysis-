This study analyzes data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to investigate the potential impact of specific demographic and lifestyle factors—namely, an individual’s weight, number of children, 
and average weekly work hours—on the likelihood of being diagnosed with diabetes at a particular age. By employing a range of statistical techniques and visualizations, the research seeks to identify patterns and relationships 
between these independent variables and the dependent variable: diabetes diagnosis. The analysis aims to uncover significant correlations that may highlight risk factors contributing to diabetes onset, 
providing valuable insights into the role of lifestyle behaviors and demographic characteristics in shaping diabetes risk across different age groups.
